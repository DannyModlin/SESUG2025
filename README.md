# SESUG2025
Welcome to SAS Campus and SESUG 2025. We are happy to host this year's user group meeting. Within this GitHub area, you will find access to all the presentation materials of the five talks that I will be giving across the event.

## Statistical Analysis in SAS: The Not-So-Scary Overview
9/23  8:30a-9:00a

Are you new to using SAS procedures for statistical analysis? Has it been a while since you were in your last statistics course? Are you wondering what are the differences among various procedures used in data exploration and modeling? This presentation is perfect for you! We start with a look at data exploration through procedures like PROC MEANS, PROC UNIVARIATE, etc. We then move to modeling using PROC REGSELECT, PROC GLMSELECT and more. We complete our discussion with categorical data analysis using PROC FREQ, PROC LOGISTIC, and PROC LOGSELECT. This presentation will consider both SAS 9 procedures and CAS enabled procedures within SAS Viya.

This presentation will be using SAS VFL through Jupyter Notebook. The related files are in the NotSoScaryStats folder. The ipynb file is the Jupyter notebook file that holds the slide images as well as all data and program code that we will reference.

## The GENMOD Toolkit: What do you do when things aren't Normal?
9/23   9:00a-9:30a

Life is nice in the statistical world when things are normal (distributed that is). We have performed multitudes of regression analyses where the residuals meet the required assumptions of normality. What happens when this normality is not present? What do you do when your response variable is a count or a rate? Welcome to the world of generalized linear models! In this presentation, we will explore this expansion from normality using the GENMOD procedure in SAS. Suggestions for deciding which distribution to use will be shared. Our discussion and examples will also include a look into zero-inflation and one of the more interesting distributions, the Tweedie distribution.

This presentation will be using SAS VFL through Jupyter Notebook. The related files are in the GENMOD folder. The ipynb file is the Jupyter notebook file that holds the slide images as well as all data and program code that we will reference.

## PROC BGLIMM: The Smooth Transition to Bayesian Analysis
9/23   2:30p-3:00p

Many analysts are interested in taking models they currently have and transitioning them to the Bayesian realm. Most leap from their favorite classical analysis procedure directly to PROC MCMC, the general-purpose Bayesian procedure. This presentation will feature the BGLIMM procedure available since SAS/STAT 15.1. This will allow the participant to model non-normal responses and include random effects within their Bayesian approach. Discussion will include options of priors and availability of statements. Examples will include models originally written in PROCs REG, GLM, GLMSELECT, GENMOD, MIXED, and GLIMMIX.

This presentation will be using SAS VFL through Jupyter Notebook. The related files are in the BGLIMM folder. The ipynb file is the Jupyter notebook file that holds the slide images as well as all data and program code that we will reference.

## Large-Scale Time Series Forecasting in Model Studio
9/24  8:30a-10:00a

In this hands-on workshop, you learn to build time series models for large-scale time series problems with many hierarchically related series. You will experience the capability of Model Studio to diagnose, fit, and assess models for many time series at once. Use the new Hierarchical Modeling Node to create time series models at each of the levels of the hierarchy. Need to extract your reconciled predictions from each level of the hierarchy? No problem. Within the Hierarchical Modeling Node, you can dive into each level of the hierarchy and export these desired predictions.

## Easily Turn Your Automated Explanation into a Predictive Model
9/24  2:00p-3:30p

The Automated Explanation in SAS® Visual Analytics is a powerful and easy way to start your journey into building predictive models. We'll start by creating an Automated Explanation to analyze our data and pick up on key drivers that appear. We will then easily move into building a predictive model using SAS® Visual Statistics. Data Scientists and Business Analyst will see how easy it is to take that next leap in their data analysis. Code will not be harmed, examined, nor executed during this workshop.
