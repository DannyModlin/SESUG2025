Welcome to SAS Campus and SESUG 2025. We are happy to host this year's user group meeting. Within this GitHub area, you will find access to all the presentation materials of the five talks that I will be giving across the event.

## Statistical Analysis in SAS: The Not-So-Scary Overview
9/23  8:30a-9:00a

Are you new to using SAS procedures for statistical analysis? Has it been a while since you were in your last statistics course? Are you wondering what are the differences among various procedures used in data exploration and modeling? This presentation is perfect for you! We start with a look at data exploration through procedures like PROC MEANS, PROC UNIVARIATE, etc. We then move to modeling using PROC REGSELECT, PROC GLMSELECT and more. We complete our discussion with categorical data analysis using PROC FREQ, PROC LOGISTIC, and PROC LOGSELECT. This presentation will consider both SAS 9 procedures and CAS enabled procedures within SAS Viya.

This presentation will be using SAS VFL through Jupyter Notebook. The related files are in the NotSoScaryStats folder. The ipynb file is the Jupyter notebook file that holds the slide images as well as all data and program code that we will referece.
